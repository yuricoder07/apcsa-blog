# Smooth Commit and Push: 

- The seamless integration makes committing and pushing changes to your repositories smoother than ever. You can stage and commit changes, create branches, and push to remote repositories using simple commands within VS Code.

# Effortless Code Collaboration: 

- With the GitHub tools in VS Code, collaborating with others becomes a breeze. You can easily review and merge pull requests, respond to comments, and address issuesâ€”all within the familiar VS Code interface. This reduces context switching and accelerates collaboration.

# Faster Issue Tracking: 

- the integrated tools allow you to manage issues and project boards right from your editor. This means you can create, update, and organize issues without navigating to the GitHub website, saving you valuable time.
