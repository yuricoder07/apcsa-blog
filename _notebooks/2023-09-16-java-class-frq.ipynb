    "- **Definition:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Classes encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit, promoting data hiding and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Creation:** Objects are instances of a class, created using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access Modifiers:** Classes, fields, and methods can have access modifiers like `public`, `private`, `protected`, or package-private to control visibility and access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constructor:** A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created. It initializes the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Java supports single inheritance, where a class can inherit fields and methods from one superclass using the `extends` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method Overloading:** Java allows defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class. This is called method overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Instance Variables:** These are attributes or fields that belong to an instance of a class. They represent the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static Variables and Methods:** Static members belong to the class itself, rather than instances of the class. They are accessed using the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and methods define a blueprint for derived classes to implement. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interface:** An interface is a contract that defines a set of abstract methods that implementing classes must provide. Multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessors and Mutators:** Accessor methods (getters) and mutator methods (setters) are used to control access to the class's fields and enforce encapsulation.\n"

    "# Quick Lesson: Java Classes and Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a subclass called textbook from the original book class\n",
    "- Make the textbook class take editions as a parameter\n",
    "- Create a accessor method called getBookInfo that returns info about a object\n",
    "- Create a method canSubsitutefor which returns a boolean depending if a textbook object can replace another textbook object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes**: Templates for creating objects in Java.\n",
    "- **Objects**: Instances of classes that represent real-world entities.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: Allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: Keeping data and methods together for better organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction (30 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes and Objects**: In Java, classes are like blueprints, and objects are instances created from these blueprints.\n",
    "- **Inheritance**: We'll explore how one class can inherit characteristics from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create the `Book` Class (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define `Book` Class**: We'll start by defining the `Book` class.\n",
    "- **Attributes**: It has two attributes: `title` and `price`.\n",
    "- **Methods**: We'll create a constructor to initialize these attributes, and two methods, `getTitle` and `getBookInfo`, to access and display data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Implement Inheritance (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introduce `Textbook`**: Next, we'll introduce the `Textbook` class, which is a subclass of `Book`.\n",
    "- **Additional Attribute**: It has an additional attribute, `edition`, which represents the book's edition number.\n",
    "- **Method for Comparison**: We'll add a method, `canSubstituteFor`, to check if one textbook can substitute another based on title and edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Run and Test (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create Objects**: We'll demonstrate how to create objects of both `Book` and `Textbook` classes.\n",
    "- **Access Data**: We'll use methods to retrieve and display book information.\n",
    "- **Test Inheritance**: We'll test the `canSubstituteFor` method to see how inheritance works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Recap and Key Points (30 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Takeaways**: Summarize the main concepts learned: classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation.\n",
    "- **Organization**: Discuss how organizing data and methods in classes makes code more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Encourage Exploration (30 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Further Learning**: Suggest practicing with more classes, exploring advanced concepts like polymorphism, and building larger projects.\n",
    "- **Resources**: Mention that there are abundant online resources and tutorials for Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Q&A and Discussion (30 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engagement**: Invite questions and engage in a brief discussion about real-world applications of classes and inheritance.\n",
    "- **Curiosity**: Encourage students to explore Java's capabilities and discover their own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quick introduction to essential Java concepts.\n",
    "- Hands-on coding experience.\n",
    "- Understanding the power of inheritance for code organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson offers a quick dive into Java classes and inheritance. Experiment and explore to strengthen your understanding!"
